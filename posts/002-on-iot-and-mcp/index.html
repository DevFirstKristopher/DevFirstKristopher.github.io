          <p>This <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinswiber/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3B090APMCfRQeaZh96528SPQ%3D%3D">great post by Kevin Swiber</a> got me thinking about the mid-2010s dream of the IoT and the concerns and issues it generated. This is going to be a bit stream-of-consciousness, but follow me on this.</p>
<p>First, some background. During the heyday of IoT in the early-through-mid 2010s, there was this dream of having an interconnected network of devices using micro computing and the cloud to provide next-gen systems. One example I often gave was the idea of having a heart monitor IoT device that connected to your watch, local monitoring, your phone, etc., so that you could identify health issues, treat them, and monitor efficacy and safety over time.</p>
<p>The big concern I had then was around security - I talked about this on a <a href="https://lnkd.in/ghuXMDrX0">Nordic APIs LiveCast</a>, but my core theory evolved into &ldquo;this is a lot of danger and work for something that doesn&rsquo;t really do much more than dumb devices reporting to a local network&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I felt like the security issues (hacking your body to kill a target was a serious concern I had for something like an IoT pacemaker) really weren&rsquo;t worth the minor gains in processing speed or code locality. It felt like we were exposing a lot of systems that didn&rsquo;t really need to be exposed, and while I certainly am no luddite, I felt like this was maybe a step too far - it would have to wait for some big evolution.</p>
<p>Following Kevin&rsquo;s post (which I responded to <a href="https://lnkd.in/gVRuMn6D">here</a>), I started thinking about what these IoT use cases might look like with LLMs. Right now LLMs are by and large too big for local systems, but they&rsquo;re getting smaller and more efficient. As these systems evolve to be more portable, and local storage of 2025 scales in huge degrees compared to storage of 2005, I&rsquo;ve started to reconsider what I felt was the &ldquo;dead dream of IoT&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Put simply, I am getting the feeling that a combinatory solution like SPIFFE for workload attestation paired with MCP servers to provide scalable contextualization might be that evolution I was waiting for. If the problem is safety, in theory workload attestation through SPIFFE/SPIRE should resolve a lot of those concerns. And if the issue was efficacy and locality of processing, a local mini-LLM leveraging cloud-based or local MCP resourcing to provide context (e.g. health records collected automatically, medicine guidelines (in the US, USPI) should resolve that issue handily if properly built out.</p>
